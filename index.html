            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
              Mohammed Fadhel Aljunid received his Ph.D. from Mangalore University (India). His research interests revolve around human data processing, machine learning, deep learning, recommender systems, sentiment analysis, and NLP. Specifically, he developed a deep learning-based collaborative filtering algorithm that integrates explicit and implicit feedback to address the cold start and sparsity problems. He also investigated novel approaches for collaborative filtering recommender systems through discussion article reviews. In addition to his academic research. Currently, he serves as the Head of the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology at Al-Dhale' University and as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the College of Computer Science and Information Systems, Al-Razi University.

    My research focuses on developing collaborative filtering recommender systems by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. Specifically, I address key challenges such as the cold start and data sparsity problems by designing models that integrate both explicit and implicit user feedback. My work explores the use of deep neural networks to enhance traditional collaborative filtering approaches, aiming to improve recommendation accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic user preferences. This research combines expertise from recommender systems, machine learning, deep learning, and large-scale data processing to build more intelligent and robust recommendation frameworks.
